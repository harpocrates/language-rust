This module provides functions for turning ASTs into values of type 'Language.Rust.Pretty.Doc'.
These values can then be rendered into concrete string types using functions from the
@prettyprinter@ package. This has some advantages over printing plain old strings:

  * /Backend independent/: you can use a variety of existing backends to efficiently render to all
    sorts of formats like 'Data.Text.Text', 'String', HTML, and terminal.

  * /Dynamic layouts/: the AST will render differently depending on the desired page width

        >>> :set -XTypeApplications -XOverloadedStrings
        >>> import Language.Rust.Parser
        >>> import Data.Text.Prettyprint.Doc.Util ( putDocW )
        >>> let src = parse' @(SourceFile Span) "fn foo(x: i32, y: i32, z: i32) -> i32 { x - y + z }"
        >>> let doc = pretty' src <> "\n"
        >>> putDocW 80 doc
        fn foo(x: i32, y: i32, z: i32) -> i32 {
            x - y + z
        }
        >>> putDocW 10 doc
        fn foo(
          x: i32,
          y: i32,
          z: i32,
        ) -> i32 {
          x - y + z
        }

  * /Annotations/: Depending on the backend you are using to render the 'Language.Rust.Pretty.Doc',
    annotations can determine colours, styling, links, etc.

The examples below assume the following GHCi flag and import:

>>> :set -XOverloadedStrings
>>> import Language.Rust.Syntax.AST
