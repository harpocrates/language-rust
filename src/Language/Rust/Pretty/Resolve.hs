/NOTE:/ the following uses hithero unimplemented antiquoting syntax

An AST and its text form /should/ be completely isomorphic, with @parse@ and @pretty@ being the
functions allowing you to go back and forth between these forms. Unfortunately, this cannot really
be the case. The AST form can express programs which cannot be literally pretty printed and still
make sense. Sometimes, extra parens or semicolons need to be added.

== Simple example

For example, consider the following interaction

>>> import Language.Rust.Quote
>>> import Language.Rust.Pretty
>>> :set -XQuasiQuotes
>>> x = [expr| 2 + 3 |]
>>> y = [expr| 1 * $x |]
>>> pretty y
0 * 1 + 2

The problem is that we haven't introduced the paren AST node (which we would have gotten had we
parsed @1 * (2 + 3)@. This is where 'resolve' steps in.

>>> Right y' = resolve y
>>> pretty y'
0 * (1 + 2)

== More involved example

From the above, it is tempting to say: your pretty printer should be smarter! However, things are
not always so simple. Consider the less obvious example:

>>> fnBody = [expr| { let y = x; x += 1; y } + x |]
>>> fn = [item| fn foo(mut x: i32) -> i32 { $fnBody } |]
>>> pretty fn
fn foo(mut x: i32) -> i32 {
  { let y = x; x += 1; y } + x
}

This is clearly not the desired output - this won't compile with @rustc@ because of an invariant in
blocks: if the block ends in an expression, that expression cannot start with a block. To fix this,
we call 'resolve' on the AST before pretty printing it.

>>> Right fn' = resolve fn
>>> pretty fn'
fn foo(mut x: i32) -> i32 {
  ({ let y = x; x += 1; y }) + x
}

And now we have generated valid code.
